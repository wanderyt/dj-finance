# By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS.
# Specify a browser to override this behavior, or set it to none to disable it completely.
# If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead.
# Any arguments passed to npm start will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument.
# Your script's file name must have the .js extension.

# Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server's root or a subpath as specified in package.json (homepage).
# Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname.
# You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included).
# This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.

# When set to true, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching.

# When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace.
# When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file.
# You can send a pull request to detect your editor of choice.
# Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection.
# If you do it, make sure your systems PATH environment variable points to your editorâ€™s bin folder.
# You can also set it to none to disable it completely.

# Use this option if npm start isn't detecting changes.

# By default, Create React App will embed the runtime script into index.html during the production build.
# When set to false, the script will not be embedded and will be imported as usual.
